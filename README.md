# C Linked List Implementation

## Author
Adi Levy

## Description
This project implements a singly linked list in C to practice pointers, structs, and dynamic memory management. 
It includes advanced operations beyond simple insertion, providing a foundation for understanding low-level data structures.

## Features
- Add node at the end or at a specific index
- Remove node by index or by value
- Update value of a specific node
- Retrieve value of a specific node
- Print all node values
- Compute sum of all nodes

## How to Compile and Run
```bash
gcc linkedList.c -o linkedList
./linkedList
```
## What I learned
- How to manage dynamic memory manually using malloc and free
- How to use pointers to navigate and manipulate linked data structures
- Struct design and modular code organization
- Implementing multiple linked list operations with edge-case handling
- Debugging and testing complex pointer-based code
